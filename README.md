# RNGTats
A script to generate a random tattoo idea.

1. Pretty simple, inspired by my RNGScript. Script uses 3 lists - styles, shapes and colors. When rolling, you only specify number of colors,
the rest is set to pop out 1 result.
2. Lists are stored in external files, if there are not lists available, script will create those automatically, asking for first position of each list,
to keep things formatted and bugfree.
3. Lists can be extended using the script, or manually through adding lines to .txt files which should be present in script folder after a succesfull first run.
4. Might get some additional functionality, for now it's just a fun project for a tattoo artist looking for inspirations :).
